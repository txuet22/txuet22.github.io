I was just about to finish my shift for the day, when she walk in for her first day of work. She looked lost and confuse, so I introduce myself and welcoming my new co-worker. Maybe it was my kindness that caught her attention. She was very friendly and talkative for being her first day. We both connected really well, like we knew each other for years. We exchange phone numbers a few days after that day. We talk and text for a while but I didn't have the courage to ask her for a date. Finally after a few weeks, I build enough courage to ask her for a date and we went to the movies. Life just played its roles after this first date and now we are happily married with 2 children. How I would ever thought that Taco Bell is my calling place. </p>
