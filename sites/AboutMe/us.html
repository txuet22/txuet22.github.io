                <h1>My Lovely Wife</h1>
                <p>Her name his Shouayee Christie Lee. She is as lovely as ever. Her eyes! Everytime she stares with those beautiful elegant eyes, I'm dazzle by them. Her voice is as smooth as the thousandths choir singing "Silent Night" on Christmas Eve. Christie's hair is long and pretty like the stars from above at night. Just every inch of her is perfection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is American born but was born to a family of immigrant from the hills of Laos. Her parents came to the USA in the early 1980's, fleeing from the Vietnam War, at the age of young adults. She was the first child of my father and mother in-law's family. She has totals of 5 siblings: 3 brothers and 2 sisters. Being the oldest, she proud herself to be the best older sister she can be. She took role as a mother to help around the house like cooking and cleaning while my mother/father in-law was both working at that time. She made sure little brothers/sisters was able to finish dinner, homeworks, and shower before bed. Christie learn how to be a mother before she even became a mom. Now, she is also currently a full-time employee and mother. She works in the morning then comes home to take care of our two children while I go to school. Is she truely the definition of a super mother!
