                    <p class="text-white-50">I've always wanted to teach what I know to whomever wants to learn it. My father wants said, "Don't be greedy with your knowledge, what you know, you must share. You might be the next great philosopher." As a player, you may put yourself in situation that you wouldn't know how to react to it. But as a coach, your job is to identify those flaws and teach the players to get better or avoid it. The famous USA basketball Coach K quote, "A good coach sees in you what you can't see in yourelf" I use his moto to impliment my teaching into my players. Since I step away from competitive volleyball, coaching is my way of life. I may not be the best coach, but I can definitly say, "I was there once!"   </p>
