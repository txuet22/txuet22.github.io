                    <p class="text-white-50">I've been playing volleyball every since I was 13 years old. It has been about fifthteen years in the making. I feel in love with the sport every since I was introduce to by a group of middle school friends who just wanted to get by during lunch break. How I never thought I could accomplish so much by playing volleyball? Growing up in the neighborhood where drugs and gangs was around the corner, playing volleyball was my way out. Instead of hanging out with friends that do drugs or gangbang, I kept playing and stayed away from the bad enviroment. I didn't take volleyball serious until my freshman year in high school, when I was put on the bench on the fresnhman volleyball team. I had to better myself or I'll just sit on the bench supporting my teammates only. After the season was over of my freshman year, I woke up every morning to run 1 mile everyday. Then when school was over, I'll head out to practice with my brothers and cousins until 9pm. Boy, did it paid off! The following year, not only did I made the varsity volleyball team as a starter but also name the best volleyball player at my school. But after all my hard work, I didn't finish the season due to my selfness and was booted from the team. At that time, I was facing my own demons. My thoughts and feelings were, "I'm to good to be practicing with them or why do I need to practice, when I'm the best player on the court?" I would had come knowledge that this was my biggest mistake. My team lost in the first round playoffs and would never see another playoffs after that. After highschool, I didn't get recruited to any college because coaches and scouts haven't seen me performed. Then I just stop playing the sport I love for awhile, until I was reintroduce to hmong outdoor volleyball competitions. You didn't have to be good to compete, you just need a team and money to pay for registration fee at tournaments. Starting all the way from the bottom, I slowing building myself up. After a few years playing, with many loses, I was able to lead my team to a many 1st place volleyball tournaments. My most memoriable win, was the year of 2016 on the biggest tournaments in hmong community held in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was call the Freedom Celebration July 4th Sport Competition and its equivalent to like the NFL Superbowl. After all these sequence, I decided to hung up my jersey and come back to continue my pursue in Web-development. Volleyball have tought me a lot and also led me to be the man I am today. Volleyball is my safe haven!  </p>
