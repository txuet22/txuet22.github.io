        <p class="text-white-50 mx-auto mt-2 mb-5">One my other goal is to spend time with my families. First, I want to spend
            more time with my two little boys and wife. Being a full-time employee and student, making time is hard. Everyday
            my boys would ask their mom, "where is daddy going?" This breaks my heart to hear them say that, so I decided to
            made them my priority when i can. Some of my goal set for my boys are to take them to the pumpkin patch, cook them
            dinners, spend time shopping with them on holiday gifts, and etc. I also want to record all of my events with them
            to show myself at the end of the year. I even bought a tripod to hold my phone up while recording. Before my dad
            pass away of 2011, my siblings and I was not close. We hardly talk to each other or do family events as a family.
            Now, we are closer since the passing of my father, but I do wish to spend more time with them. Life is so short,
            spend time with the people that you want to be with. Just in a instance and it will all be gone. I just want to
            live my life to the fullest. </p>
